Unstructured video-based rendering: interactive exploration of casually captured videos

MS-SfS - Multi-source shape-from-silhouette

FVV techniques - 2 groups:
image-based, where the intermediate views between cameras are generated using interpolation or warping of the available images; and geometry-based techniques, where 3D geometry of both the dynamic foreground and static background is acquired, allowing the rendering from any other viewpoint.

billboard interpolation -  scene is captured using handheld commodity cameras, both foreground masks and camera pose are recovered at every frame, and a simple model of the background is reconstructed to improve the visual experience in camera transitions.
